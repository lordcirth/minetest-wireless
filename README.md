minetest-wireless
=================

wireless digilines mod. 
No compilation needed.
I recommend that you drop this folder into games/minetest_game/mods/minetest-mod-digilines, and rename it to just "wireless" .
Depends upon whole mesecons, digilines modpacks.
Crafting recipes can be found at the end of init.lua .

If you want to contribute, please make better textures and nodeboxes - the current ones are placeholders.
